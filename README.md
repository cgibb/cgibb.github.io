cgibb.github.io
===============

Within a year I'll be losing my ability to get free hosting through UMD.
I heard about github.io for personal hosting, gave it a look, and with the tools available and whatnot it seems like a pretty 
nifty place for me to try out something fancier than a homemade stylesheet (and more time to focus on the important stuff).

Enjoy!
